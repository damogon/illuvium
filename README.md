Illuvium Task

## Description

A deterministic system has been created in Unreal Engine that operates at a fixed tick of 100ms (configurable). The system consists of a series of units from two teams (red and blue) that move towards each other on a grid and attack each other until one team wins.

To do this, an Actor Component has been created that runs the simulation in a custom Game Mode, which keeps it alive for the duration of the game.

The units are spheres that glow brighter when they attack and are attacked, and disappear when they are defeated. The number of units on each team is configurable in Game Mode, as are the grid size, attack range, speed, and other parameters.

## Requeriments

### Unreal Engine version

This task was created in Unreal Engine version 5.5.4.
